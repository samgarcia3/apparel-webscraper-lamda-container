# Apparel Product Details and Image Web Scraper for AWS Lambda Deployment

This project containerises a web scraper that can query Product Images and Product Details then scrape and save a specified number of results to an AWS S3 Bucket of choice.

This web scraper uses beautiful soup and scrapy to extract clothing information onto a csv file. Later the project will be migrated to a back end framework to use as an API. 

# Background
